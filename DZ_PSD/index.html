request originated in Marketing. When Web sites are being designed, the folks in
Marketing often feel like they don’t have much clout. Even though they’re the
ones who spend the most time trying to figure out who the site’s audience is and
what they want, the designers and developers are the ones with most of the
hands-on control over how the site actually gets put together.</p>
